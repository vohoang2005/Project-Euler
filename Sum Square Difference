The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12+22+...+102=385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

First Solution.
def sum_of_square(n)
    return n if n == 1

    (n * n) + (sum_of_square(n-1))
end

def square_of_sum(num)
    return num if num == 1
    num = (1..num)

    num.sum ** 2
    
end

def total(number)
    square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_square(number)
end

p total(100)

-------------------------------------------------
Better Solution.

def sum_square_difference(n)
    numbers = (1..n)
    square_of_sum = numbers.sum ** 2
    sum_of_square = numbers.map { |n| n ** 2 }.sum
    square_of_sum - sum_of_square
end

puts sum_square_difference(100)
