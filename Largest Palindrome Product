A Palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest Palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 =
91 x 99.
Find the largest Palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Palin = 0
for i in (100..999)
    for j in (100..999)
        k = i * j
        if (k.to_s == k.to_s.reverse && k > Palin)
            Palin = k
        end
    end
end
puts Palin
